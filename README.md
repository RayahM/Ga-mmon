* Java project to generate intelligent backgammon players implementing a genetic algorithm and then test them.
* Prototype 6

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
           Run mainTest (backgammon.game) for testing players against each other 1v1/
           Run main (backgammon.genes) to run the actual evolution and genetic algorithm, will be saved to file location specified in config
* Configuration
          To change the run environments use the classes in the backgammon.settings package and allows you to change settings e.g. GUI/CLI visible, file save location, population size etc.
* Dependencies
          The only libraries I imported and used were those for JUnitTesting that are included within the /libs folder
